## iPhone Remote Control (LAN)

You can optionally control the timer from your iPhone using a local web page served by the desktop app.

1. Open the app -> Settings -> enable "iPhone Remote Control (LAN)" -> Save.
2. Find your Mac's Wi‑Fi IP: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
3. On iPhone Safari open: `http://YOUR_MAC_IP:PORT/?token=TOKEN`

Your Mac and iPhone must be on the same Wi‑Fi, and the app must be running.
